rust (programming language)

Rust is a general purpose multi-paradigm compiled programming language
with a focus on memory safety.

Rust is designed to be a "safe, concurrent, practical language",
supporting pure-functional, concurrent-actor, imperative-procedural,
and object-oriented styles.

Rust is developed by Mozilla Research as a system programming language

Concurrency: lightweight tasks with message passing, no shared memory
Generics: type parameterization with type classes
Exception handling: unrecoverable unwinding with task isolation
Memory model: optional task-local GC, safe pointer types with region analysis
